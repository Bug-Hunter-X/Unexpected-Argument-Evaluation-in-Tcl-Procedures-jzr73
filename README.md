This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Tcl programming.  The issue arises from how Tcl handles word splitting and command substitution in procedure calls. When a procedure argument contains spaces or special characters, Tcl may attempt to interpret it as a command, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. The `bug.tcl` file shows an example of this error, and `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version.
